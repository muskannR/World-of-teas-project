Tea... Is it just a drink or is there something more behind it? From an early age tea was one of the main parts of daily life in different cultures and civilizations.  
Tea connects people, calms the mind, brings harmony and balance.    
**Art of Tea** is a refuge for a soul in the bustle of the city, an island of calm in the very heart of Dublin!   
Tea ceremonies in our tea club proceed in the atmosphere of solitude and relaxation. This is an immersion into the secrets of the tea consuming traditions of the nations of the world, as well as a place for romantic dates and meetings with friends.

In **Art of Tea** you can visit one of our tea ceremonies, book an event for your company and buy nice fresh tea and teaware delivered straight to your doors!

Explore the misterious and amazing world of tea with us!

### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.
#### Colour Scheme
One of the main goals in UI was to focus user's attention on the products/services images. Therefore **calm** colors and **different shades** of one colour were mostly used accross the website's design.   
**Green** and **black** are the colours associated with tea world, help us to immerse users to the **tea world**. While bright **salmon** colour is used for some headings and icons to create a contrast and catch user's attention.   
 Different shades of grey colour and shadows allow us to create clean and neat backgrounds and volume effect accross the website.   
 
![Color Palette](wireframes/colour-palette.png)
#### Typography
There are three fonts used across the project that I find a good combination: 
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) used as the main body font, popular modern sans-serif typeface providing good readability.
- [Marko One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marko+One) - elegant, decorative and eye-catching font, used mostly for headings.  
- [Sawarabi Mincho](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sawarabi+Mincho) - clean and simple font, perfectly fit to the "Art of Tea" and "East culture" theme, used for navbar elements and some headings.
#### Icons
Icons are used widely, as they are good attention grabbers. They help users to find and scan content quickly and easily. Another advantage of using them is to help to break language barriers. They create more user-friendly experience for people with non-native English by giving the visual clue about the subject.   
- I used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation).
- Apart from that, I used some icons, specific to the tea world and East topic, that were found in a free icon library [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) - used in Landing and Events pages. 

### Wireframes
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) tool was used to create all wireframes for the project.   

Original wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile can be found [here](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).


**Note:** The website was changed and evolved through the development process and several improvements were applied.
The wireframes served as guidelines but some details such as positioning, placement of 
 images, buttons and other refinements diverge from the original wireframes.    
 Apart from that, there are some features that are included into original wireframes (such as reviews, social account login, user's avatar, image galleries for services/products), 
 but were considered of secondary importance and were not implemented yet due to time constraints. This is reflected and described in details in [Features left to implement](#features-left-to-implement) section, and I intend to come back to them and implement them in future when I can dedicate more time to it.

## Features
Art of Tea website is composed by eight applications: `landing`, `about`, `events`, `contact`, `products`(contains products and services), `cart`, `checkout`, `profiles`.
### Existing Features     
#### Navbar
The navbar is fixed at the top of the page all the time, this allows a user to easily navigate throughout the website.
 The **logo** is located in the top left corner on a desktop and in the center on the smaller devices. 
 It redirects a user to the home/landing page when clicked. On smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) 
 the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. Menu links appear when the burger icon is clicked and collapse back, when clicked again.    
 
Navbar also contains a **search box**, where a user can search for product. It is collapsed into a search icon on the mobile and tablet, and slides down when the icon is clicked.     
Also, navbar contains a **cart icon** along with a grand total displayed if there are items in the cart added. It changes the colour to yellow when there's something
in the cart to catch user's attention, and remains white (as other navbar elements) when the cart is empty. Clicking the cart icon redirects a user to the cart page.   

On the large screens an active page is highlighted (colour changes to green) depending on which page a user is currently on.      
The difference in navbar for logged in, non-logged in users and admin:   
 - <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jhmctpR/navbar-for-guests.png" alt="navbar_for_guests" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="850">    
For **non-logged in** users or guests navbar contains the following links: Login, Register.   
 - <img src="https://i.ibb.co/zXvBMvK/navbar-loggedin-users.png" alt="navbar_for_logged_in_users" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="850">    
For **logged in** users it contains the **"My Account"** nav-item which toggles down the following links that redirect user to the corresponding pages: My Profile, Order History, Logout.   
- For **admin** apart from all the links available for logged-in users mentioned above, there is also a link to the **Product Management page**, where admin can add new products and services. This is avaliable only for superusers. Defensive design with corresponding error messages is in place to protect this page from manual entering the url in the browser.
#### Footer

Footer consists of 2 parts: main footer section and additional footer section which is displayed only on the large screens.   

Main footer section is stuck to the bottom of the page and displayed across all the screens. It contains the **social media icon-links** which redirect a user to the corresponding page, opening in a new tab. GitHub and LinkedIn icons open author of the project's profile, while Instagram and Facebook icons open the main pages, as it is not the real company.   
The additional desktop only section contains

- **Hero image** section contains a full-screen image, main heading with a subheading and 2 buttons "Book tea ceremony" and "Buy tea or teaware" that redirect a user to the services and products pages, correspondingly. The purpose of this section is to attract new users, to make the first impression and to call to action.

- Clicking on **Add to cart** button will add the product to the cart with quantity equal to 1, clicking again will simply updates the quantity by 1.

Delete button toggles the Delete modal. It asks a superuser to confirm if the product is to be deleted. If so, upon clicking "Delete" button, the product will not be removed from the database, but will set as **discontinued** and will be removed from the user's view. Then the page reloads and the toast-message will inform about the sucessfull deletion. There is also a button "Cancel" that closes the modal when it's clicked. These actions can be done only by superuser, attempts to access them by other users will end up with redirection to the landing page with toast error messages displayed.

- **Checkout form** is represented as 3 tabs with the **Next** and **Go back** buttons to navigate between the tabs. The form sections are the following: **Personal Details**, **Billing/Shipping info** and **Payment**.
- If a user already has a profile with the shipping information saved, the form will be pre-populated with this information.
- The **validation** messages will be displayed on click **Next** button, so a user can move on the next tab only if the current form-section is filled with valid information.
- The **save info** checkbox allows the form information to be saved to the user's profile for the **logged in** users.
- If it's a new or **non-logged** user there are links to register or login pages, in case a user wants to save the information to their profile.
- Before proceeding the payment, user can review and check all the information in the table (**Form Summary**).
- There's also an optional **Comment** field for cases if a user has any additional comments to the order.
- A user is informed how much the card will be charged in the paragraph below the **Proceed to payment** button.
- Since the website is made for educational purposes only and the Stripe functionality is only for testing, only **4242 4242 4242 4242** card number will lead to the successfull payment. A user is asked to provide card number, expiration date (any date in future) and CVC (any numbers). 
- A webhook is used to make sure that the order is processed even in the cases when the payment process is interrupted (e.g. if a user accidentally closes the page or browser after clicking "Proceed to payment" button).

#### Admin product managment
Product managment feature is available only for **authenticated superuser**.
Admin page allows an owner of the website to add new products/services by filling out one of the two forms - **Add New Product** and **Add New Service** on the Product Management page. 
If the form is valid, the product/service is added to the database and the user is redirected to the new created product/service details page.
The defensive design is implemented to restrict other than admin users to manually enter the url to get access to the page. User will be redirected to the home page with the toast error messages appeared.
**Edit** and **Delete** product/service functionality allow an admin to make the corresponding manipulations. The Delete functionality was updated during the development, so the product/service is not being completely removed from the database, but set as discontinued and is hidden from the user's view and can be set as active again any time.
#### Django-allauth features
##### Sign Up
The sign up page allows a user to create a new account. The user is asked to fill the fields "email", "username", "password" and "password (again)". When adding a username, the code compares it against existing email to ensure that it is unique. If user's input does not meet requirements, flash messages will inform a user about the error. When the form is submitted, a **verification email** is sent to the user's email to verify the email and finish registration process.   
There is also a link to the login page for existing users at the bottom of the form.    
 The Registration page is only available to anonymous users and logged-in users are redirected out automatically.
##### Login
The login page features the form with "username" and "password" fields, allowing registered users to log into their account. If the login was successfull, a user is redirected to the home page and the toast success message appears informing that the log in was successful. Otherwise, flash messages will be displayed about incorrect user's input.   
There is also a link to the sign up page for new users at the bottom of the form.
As well as that, there's a link to the **forgot password** functionality, using which a user can reset their password.
The login page is only available to anonymous users and logged-in users are redirected out automatically.
##### Forgot password
A user can reset their password to be able to login by entering the email. Then the link for reseting password will be sent to the email provided. The user can create a new password and then login with a new password.
##### Logout
Hitting "logout" button renders logout page, asking to confirm if a user wants to logout. It will end their session and redirects to the homepage with a toast success message appeared.
#### 404 and 500 error pages
Custom 404 and 500 pages contain heading, short information about the error and a button "Back Home". As well as that, they display navbar that allows users to come back easily to any page if they got lost.
#### Back to Top button
Back to Top button allows a user to scroll up to the top of the page, that makes a navigation easier.
#### Sorting products by price/name/rating
Users can sort products by price(high to low and low to high), rating(high to low and low to high) and name(A-Z and Z-A).

### Features Left to Implement
There are some features that I considered were of secondary importance and I have not implemented them yet due to time constraints, but intend to do so in future when I will be able to dedicate more time to them. Most of these features are displayed in my [original wireframes](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).
#### Star based  Rating and Reviews
This will be the first priority feature I would like to implement in future. Users would be able to create, edit and delete their reviews for products and services. Rating would be displayd as stars(0-5) in the product details and service details pages. Also, in the landing page reviews section, the static reviews would be replaced with the real ones, displaying up to 5 random reviews from the database.
#### User avatar
This feature would allow users to assign the standard randomly picked avatar or upload their own photos/avatar. Avatar would be displayed on the user Profile page and also near the reviews, if a user have some.
####  Social account login (Google and Facebook)
This feature allows users to login using social networks accounts, Google and Facebook, that would enhance user experience and make the login process easier.
#### Image galleries 
As can be viewed in the original wireframes, I initially planned to assign up to 3 for products and 5 for service images. An attempt at this was made by creating **ImageGallery** Model in the Products app. However, this feature would require much more time to search for the suitable images, resize them and implement further functionality. So due to mentioned above time constraints the ImageGallery model was removed from the database, image and image_url fields were moved to the Product model. In the future, I would like to implement this feature and add more images to the products and services for enchancing User Experience.


Other small features are also considered to be implemented in feature, such as **Pagination** in products page, **Scroll down button** on the landing page, **Discout system**.    
I would also like to add **more products** to the store.

## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment(production), a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.
- The **User model** used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults `django.contrib.auth.models`. More information about Djangoâ€™s authentication system can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/).

## Deployment
The Art of Tea project was developed using the [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) online IDE and
using Git & GitHub for version control. It is hosted on the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) platform, with static files on WhiteNoise and user-uploaded images being hosted in AWS S3 Basket.
### Local Deployment
To be able to run this project, the following tools have to be installed:
- An IDE of your choice (I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) for creating this project)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)    

Apart from that, you also need to create accounts with the following services:
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to setup the [S3 basket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)

#### Directions
1. You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:   
`git clone https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea`    
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button **Clone or download** , then **Download Zip** button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.      
In the terminal window of your local IDE change the directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).       

Note: You can read more information about the cloning process on the [GitHub Help page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).   

2. Set up environment variables.     
Note, that this process will be different depending on IDE you use.   
In this it was done using the following way:      
    - Create `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory
    - In `.env` file set environment variables with the following syntax:     
    ```bash 
    import os  
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH_Secret key>"    
    os.environ["GOOGLE_MAP_KEY"] = "<Your Google Map key>" 
     ```
       
Read more about how to set up the Stripe keys in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)
    
3. Install all requirements from the **requirements.txt** file putting this command into your terminal:     
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`     
4. In the terminal in your IDE migrate the models to crete a database using the following commands:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
5. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) in that order into the database using the following command:    
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`        
6. Create a superuser to have an access to the the admin panel(you need to follow the instructions then and insert username,email and password):    
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`   
7. You will now be able to run the application using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py runserver`     
8. To access the admin panel, you can add the `/admin` path at the end of the url link and login using your superuser credentials.

### Heroku Deployment
*To start Heroku Deployment process, you need to clone the project as described in the [Local deployment](#local-deployment) section above.*     
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:    
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:    
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`    
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:      
`web: gunicorn art_of_tea.wsgi:application`    
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository.     
NOTE: these 1-3 steps already done in this project and included in the GitHub repository, but illistrated here as they are required for the successfull deployment to Heroku.        
As well as that, other things that are required for the Heroku deployment and have to be installed: **gunicorn** (WSGI HTTP Server), **dj-database-url** for database connection and **Psycopg** (PostgreSQL driver for Python). All of the mentioned above are *already installed* in this project in the requirements.txt file.     
4. On the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) website you need to create a **new app**, assigne a name (must be unique),set a region to the closest to you(for my project I set Europe) and click **Create app**.   
5. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type `postgres`), select **Hobby Dev â€” Free** and click **Provision** button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku **Settings** click on **Reveal Config Vars**.   
7. Set the following config variables there:     

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| GOOGLE_MAP_KEY| `<your google map key>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |

Note: More about Google Map key settings can be found [here](#google-maps-api-key-set-up).
     
8. Copy **DATABASE_URL's value**(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in **settings.py**.     
You can temporary comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:   
```bash 
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
  ```
Important Note: that's just temporary set up, this URL **should not be committed and published to GitHub** for security reasons, so make sure not to commit your changes to Git while the URL is in the settings.py.     
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
10. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) into the  Postgres database using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`      
11. Create a **superuser** for the Postgres database by running the following command(*you need to follow the instructions and inserting username,email and password*):      
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`     
12. You need to remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.    
Note: for production you get the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' from the Heroku Config Vars and use Postgress database, while for development you use the SQLite as a default database.     
13. Add your Heroku app URL to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in the settings.py file.
14. You can connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    
To do so, from the Heroku dashboard follow the steps:
-  **Deploy** section -> **Deployment method** -> select **GitHub**
-  link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project
- click **Enable Automatic Deploys** in the Automatic Deployment section
- Run `git push` command in the terminal, that would now push your code to both Github and Heroku, and perform the deployment.     

Alternatively, in the terminal you can run:    
- `heroku login`    
-  after adding and comitting to Git, run the following command:     
`git push heroku master`
15. After successful deployment, you can view your app bu clicking **Open App** on Heroku platform.
16. You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running!    
##### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** and **media files** (that will be uploaded by superuser - product/service images) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*. More about setting it up you can read in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [this tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
##### Senging email via Gmail
In order to send real emails from the application, you need to connect it to your **Gmail account**, setting up your **email address** in EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your **app password** generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.

##### Google Maps API key set up
- In the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/) create a new project.
- Click **Continue** to enable the API and any related services.
- Get an **API key** and set the API key restrictions on the **Credentials** page. You can read more about [Using API Keys documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys).
- Put your Google Maps key into the environment variable locally in the `env.py` file:     
`os.environ["GOOGLE_MAP_KEY"] = "<Your Google Map key>"` and in production in the Heroku Config Vars as `GOOGLE_MAP_KEY`.
